1st
    Install git on your system. Get it on the official site
        https://git-scm.com/download/win

2nd
    Open terminal or any command line tool.
    Go to the location where you want to initialize git.
    Type the following in the terminal
        $   git config --global user.name "Ramdayal Munda"
        $   git config --global user.email "r.dayal.munda@gmail.com"
        $   git config --global push.default matching
        $   git config --global alias.co checkout
        $   git init
    Now the git has been initialized and will continue to run until told otherwise

3rd
    We need to save file for the first time
    in the terminal Type
    (adding files)
        $   git add .
    (committing files) - 
        $   git commit -am "initial commit"

    Now the files have been applied in the current local repositpry of GIT

4th
    To add your gitHub account to the mix
    First login to your github account
    Create a new repository(public in this test)

5th
    but first we need to connect the terminal to our github account
    To this we need to create an NSS key (a security key)
    $   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
        if this doesnt work that means your have not itilialized it even once
        don't worry go ahead and type the following to generate the key
    $   ssh-keygen -of
        it will ask you for a file name just press 'ENTER'
    It will as for a passphrase- press 'ENTER' again and again
        First it confirms where you want to save the key (.ssh/id_rsa),
        and then it asks twice for a passphrase,
        which you can leave empty if you donâ€™t want to type a password when you use the key.
        However, if you do use a password, make sure to add the -o option;
        it saves the private key in a format that is more resistant to brute-force password cracking
        than is the default format.
        You can also use the ssh-agent tool to prevent having to enter the password each time.

    Now go type the hash code generation command
    $   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    It should generate a long SSH sode for you. select the code and copy it as it will be useful

6th
    Not open you github account in any browser
    Goto Setting
    Goto SSH and GPG KEYS
    Click on New SSH KEYS
        Enter a tile and paste the code you just copied.
    'Enter'

7th
    $   ssh -T git@github.com
    you will be given the following message
        The authenticity of host 'github.com (13.234.210.38)' can't be established.
        RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:nThbg6kXUpJWGl7E1IGOCspRomTxdCARLviKw6E5SY8.
    just type 'yes'
    Another mesage should be displayerd
        Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
    Warning: Permanently added 'github.com,13.234.210.38' (RSA) to the list of known hosts.
    Hi RDayalMunda! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

    Now we have logged in to github with the terminal

8th
    Now we have to type the code that were displayed when you created a new repositories
    it will be something like
    $   git remote add origin https://github.com/RDayalMunda/testing_versionControl.git
    $   git branch -M main
    $   git push -u origin main
    Once you type this you will be asked to authenticate this
    Wait for a moment till a browser pops up to get you to login to you account once again
    If not don't worry it will be automated

    You have successfully uploaded the code in that directory.
    You should go check in your github account repositories for changes

YOU have successfully initialised you terminal with your github account
